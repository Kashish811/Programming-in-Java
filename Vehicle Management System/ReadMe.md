# Vehicle Management System

This project implements a simple **Vehicle Management System in Java**.  
The application demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and method usage.

---

## 📄 Files Included

- `Vehicle.java`  
  Defines the `Vehicle` class with attributes such as brand, model, year, mileage, and engine capacity.  
  Includes methods to display details and update mileage.

- `MainVehicle.java`  
  Contains the `main` method.  
  Creates vehicle objects, invokes class methods, and manages program execution.

---

## ✨ Features

- Creation of vehicle objects using a class  
- Encapsulation using private data members and public methods  
- Getter and setter methods for controlled data access  
- Mileage calculation and update after a trip  
- Display of vehicle details in a structured format  

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

- Classes and objects  
- Encapsulation  
- Constructors  
- Getter and setter methods  
- Method invocation  
- Basic control structures  

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Ensure both `Vehicle.java` and `MainVehicle.java` are in the same directory  
2. Compile the source files:
   ```bash
   javac Vehicle.java MainVehicle.java
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java MainVehicle

---

## 📌 Notes

- The program demonstrates basic object-oriented design  
- Code is written for learning and practice purposes  
- Follows standard Java naming conventions and readability practices  
- Can be extended to manage multiple vehicles using arrays or collections
