# Menu Driven Calculator

This project implements a menu-driven calculator application in Java.  
The application performs basic arithmetic operations and demonstrates modular programming using multiple classes.

---

## 📄 Files Included

- `Calculator.java`  
  Handles user interaction, displays the menu, and controls the program flow.

- `ArithmeticOperations.java`  
  Contains methods for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

---

## ✨ Features

- Menu-driven console interface  
- Supports basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division  
- Uses `Scanner` for user input  
- Modular design using separate classes  
- Easy to extend with additional operations  

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

- Java classes and objects  
- Methods and method calls  
- Control structures (`switch`, loops)  
- User input handling  
- Modular programming  

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Ensure both `Calculator.java` and `ArithmeticOperations.java` are in the same directory  
2. Compile the source files:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java ArithmeticOperations.java
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Calculator

---

## 📌 Notes

- The program runs continuously until the user selects the exit option  
- Input validation and division by zero should be handled carefully  
- Code is written for learning and practice purposes  
- Follows basic Java conventions for readability
